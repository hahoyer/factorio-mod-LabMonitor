Monitor research progress by use of combinators
The monitor will provide signals to the circuit network.
The following signals are provided:
- for each research pack the number of labs that lack that research pack
- the number of labs in total
- the number of inactive labs
Since research is global, the monitor-combinators can be placed anywhere.
